Nepomuk developers. Most of them are command line

* nepomukserver-cli - Command line interface for 
working with nepomukserver and it's services via 
DBus. It supports starting/stoping server and services,
and executing custom method of given service ( only
if services is Introspecatable ). Works in two modes -
as command line utility, reading commands from argv
or as shell, constantly reading commands from
stdin until 'exit' or Ctrl-D
Usage: 
[ You can start nepomukserver-cli as shell to avoid
constantly typing it's executable name ]

More specifig:

Dynamic commands - these commands exists only if service

    about DBus layout of service are made.
